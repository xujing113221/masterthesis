The general objective of computer vision-based analysis of surveillance video in busy public scenes has achieved increasing attention in the last decade, both because of tremendous potential practical application value such as security monitoring and academy research challenges.
Video event recognition is a crucial application of video understanding. 
It aims to automatically detect and report situations of special interest, in particular when abnormal events happen.
Most of the existing solutions work in well-constrained surveillance settings and show good results if they are tuned to a specific predefined application.
