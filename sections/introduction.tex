\section{Contribution}

\section{Organization of the Thesis}
This thesis is structured as follows:

In Chapter~\ref{chap:relatedwork} , we will discuss about the related works. Some advanced researches and mo- dels about object detection and visual relationship detection are introduced briefly. We also demonstrate their contributions and limitations.

In Chapter ~\ref{chap:bg}, the theories about artificial neural networks and other important models such as Faster R-CNN and ODE network will be introduced.

In Chapter ~\ref{chap:framework}, the proposed framework will be shown in detail.

In Chapter ~\ref{chap:experiment}, the experimental results will be presented and analyzed in detail. Our proposed framework are evaluated on Visual Genome with three standard evaluation metrics.

In Chapter ~\ref{chap:conclusion}, we conclude our work finally and point out the future research direction.
