\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}
In the present thesis a novel unsupervised learning framework has been proposed to model the activities and interactions, to online recognize global interactions and to identify abnormal events in crowded and complicated traffic scenes. Through combining the advantages of both generative models and discriminative ones, the formulated approach provides an effective solution to the problems of high-level video events recognition and abnormal events detection in real time.
