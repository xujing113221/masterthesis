\chapter{Proposed Framework}
\label{chap:framework}
In this chapter, we will introduce our proposed framework based on HDP and GP models in detailed. At first, we discuss how to extract low-level visual features from a given video sequence. Then, we discuss how to use the generative topic model HDP to learn typical activities and interactions in the given scene. Subsequently, we propose a method to represent activities using low-level visual features and interactions using typical activities. Using these representations and learning results, a training dataset with labels will be generated and the GP classifier will be trained. Furthermore, to get better performance, the temporal dependencies between two interactions will be integrated into the classifier. Finally, we demonstrate how to define and detect abnormal events.
